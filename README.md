# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  missing error handling for database queries.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Problem

The provided Express.js route handler correctly handles the case where a user is not found in the database (returning a 404 status code).  However, it fails to handle potential errors during the database query itself.  This could lead to crashes or unexpected behavior if the database is unavailable, the query is malformed, or other database-related errors occur.

## Solution

The solution adds a `try...catch` block to encapsulate the database query.  If an error occurs during the query, the route handler catches the error and returns an appropriate error response (e.g., a 500 Internal Server Error).  This prevents unexpected crashes and provides more informative error responses to the client.
